        <h1>BEEF MISO RAMEN</h1>
        <img src ="beef.webp" alt ="a picture of beef_miso_ramen">
        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>This recipe begins with preparing a robust broth, the soul of the ramen,
            typically made by simmering a mix of beef bones, ginger, garlic, and onions. 
            The broth is then enriched with miso paste, which adds a complex and slightly tangy flavor. 
            Miso paste, made from fermented soybeans, provides the dish with its characteristic deep, earthy taste.
            The beef, ideally thinly sliced cuts like sirloin or ribeye, is marinated briefly to absorb flavors and 
            then seared until tender and juicy. The seared beef is then added to the miso broth, allowing the flavors
            to meld together.
            Ramen noodles, ideally fresh and chewy, are cooked separately and added to the broth just before serving. 
            The noodles soak up the rich broth, making each bite satisfying.</p>

        <h1>Ingrediants</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 lb beef sirloin or ribeye, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sake (optional)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ginger, grated</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Marinate the Beef:</strong> In a bowl, combine the soy sauce, sake (if using), sesame oil, minced garlic, grated ginger, salt, and pepper. Add the thinly sliced beef and mix well. Let the beef marinate for at least 15 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the Beef:</strong> Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add a little oil if needed, then sear the marinated beef slices for 1-2 minutes on each side until browned and cooked through. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Boil the Noodles:</strong> Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook the ramen noodles according to the package instructions (usually 3-4 minutes for fresh noodles or 5-6 minutes for dried). Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Soft-Boil the Eggs:</strong> Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Gently lower in the eggs and cook for 6-7 minutes for a soft yolk. Transfer the eggs to an ice bath to stop the cooking, then peel and halve them.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble the Bowls:</strong> Divide the cooked noodles among serving bowls. Ladle the hot miso broth over the noodles, ensuring each bowl gets a generous amount of broth.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the Beef:</strong> Place the cooked beef slices on top of the noodles in each bowl.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the Toppings:</strong> Arrange the soft-boiled egg halves, green onions, bean sprouts, nori, and any other toppings you prefer over the beef and noodles.</li>
            <li><strong>Garnish:</strong> Finish with a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds and a drizzle of chili oil if you like some heat.</li>
        </ol>
