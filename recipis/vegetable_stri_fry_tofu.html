    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Tofu:</strong> Drain the tofu and press it to remove excess moisture. Cut the tofu into 1-inch cubes.</li>
        <li><strong>Marinate the Tofu:</strong> In a bowl, toss the tofu cubes with 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and 1 tablespoon of sesame oil. Let it marinate for 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Tofu:</strong> Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the marinated tofu and cook until golden and crispy on all sides. Remove from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Vegetables:</strong> In the same skillet, add the remaining tablespoon of vegetable oil. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger, and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the sliced bell peppers, broccoli, and carrots, and stir-fry for 4-5 minutes until the vegetables are tender but still crisp.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Sauce:</strong> In a small bowl, mix 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1 tablespoon oyster sauce (if using), and the cornstarch mixture. Pour the sauce over the vegetables and cook for 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Tofu and Vegetables:</strong> Add the cooked tofu back to the skillet and toss everything together until the tofu is well-coated with the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Divide the stir-fry among serving plates and garnish with sliced green onions and sesame seeds. Serve hot over steamed rice or noodles.</li>
